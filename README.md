how to call things
everything is start with App

colors => AppColors
strings => AppStrings
cache => AppCache
textStyles => AppTextStyles
validate => AppValidators
sneakBar => AppSneakBar
AppLocalizationController
AppContext
AppSettingsCubit
AppSessionManager
AppBotToast

you don't need to call `Them.of(context)` it will be done for you

#Desktop devices
using WindowInitializer class you can control the initial window size, title and more
don't use flutter_screenutil it's a bad idea for targeting different screen sizes (windows , web , .. ) it's only good for mobile devices
for good practice use [MediaQuery.of(context).size, LayoutBuilder , ...]

public settings

from AppSettingsCubit you can change [theme , localization]
don't try change it directly without AppSettingsCubit

localization:
to add new language use `LocalizationSupportedData` class , add id, name , locale ....
to change default language use `AppConstant.defaultLanguage`

app settings:
to add new setting use `AppSettingsModel` class , add what you need to store it in shared preferences add it to fromJson, toJson, defaults,  and don't forget to handel it in `AppSettingsCubit`
